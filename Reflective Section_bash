1-how the script handels options and args:
for options:
i made two flags to indicate each option [-n,-v]
then used the getopts to parse these options and update the flags accordingly
after this i shifted the parsed options to move on to the arguments...
for arguments:
at the begining i needed to make sure the user enters two args with an if condition to avoid unneeded 
proceeing and exit the script .
i made a check on both args to make sure that[ the search string is not empty & the file exist ]
then finaly i fomulated the CMDs based on the flages 
i took into consuderation tha the task was to make the grep case insebsitive so i 
put the [-i] iption in all CMDs 



2-adding other options like regex or -i/-c/-l 
both can be done by using additional flags and make conditions and cases to hendle them 
but for regex we need to force the user to enter the search string between "" to avoid errors 
and use -E option for regex itself
