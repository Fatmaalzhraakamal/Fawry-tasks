1. first we Verify DNS Resolution
we want to know if the machine is using the configured dns or an external dns(8.8.8.8)
when trying 
CMD   $nslookup internal.example.com
says  server can't find internal.example.com: NXDOMAIN
which indicates that this is a DNS error
to know exactly is it local dns or not we try an external dns like (8.8.8.8)
trying 
CMD   $nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8
if it works then its a local dns problem
2. we try check netwerk issues
ping the service the the IP:
if it works so, no problem with network
if not it can be network error for example firewall is blocking
assume the ip is 10.10.10.5
3. might be problem with the port
we can try this 
CMD  $curl -I http://internal.example.com to test the port
if it reponses with some web page so it works
if not then problem with port


bonus:
to solve this like temporary we can correct the local dns entry
CMD $10.10.10.5  internal.example.com
